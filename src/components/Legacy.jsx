        <span className='text-white text-xs p-6  '>In the bustling heart of India's legal fraternity, Legum Consultants stood as a beacon of justice, its foundations built on unwavering integrity and legal excellence. At the helm was Mr. Asit Kumar Roy, a man whose name resonated across courtrooms and legal circles. A scholar with an M.A., LL.B., PG DPM, and D.Te., he was not just a legal practitioner but a visionary.
        Having embarked on his legal journey in 1992, Mr. Roy quickly became a formidable advocate, defending clients in the Supreme Court of India, High Courts, NCDRC, NGT, AFT, CAT, and numerous tribunals. His cases often found their way into leading newspapers and televised debates, where his legal acumen was sought after by journalists and legal experts alike. His relentless pursuit of justice and deep-rooted legal knowledge earned him a place among the elite, making Legum Consultants a name synonymous with trust and expertise.
        Beside him stood Mr. Anand Kumar Chauhan, a stalwart who had dedicated nearly three decades to the firm. Joining as an Associate Advocate in 1995, he grew to become the backbone of the firm’s administration and strategy. His presence was more than that of a legal expert; he was the driving force ensuring that every case, every client, and every legal battle was handled with meticulous precision.
        Together, Mr. Roy and Mr. Chauhan cultivated a firm where law was not just practiced—it was mastered. Their journey was not merely about winning cases but about upholding the principles of justice, ensuring that every client, regardless of their legal challenge, had a formidable defense.
        Thus, Legum Consultants was not just a law firm; it was a legacy—one built on dedication, expertise, and an unyielding commitment to justice.</span>
